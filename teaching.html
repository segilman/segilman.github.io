<p><b> Bio 044L Introductory Biology </b> <br>
<a href="/sgilman/syllabi/Bio44_syllabus2012.htm">past syllabus</a> 
</p>
<p>
 Together with Bio 43L, this course is a gateway to the science of biology.  We cover a broad swath of biology with the twin goals of exposing you to as many different research questions and disciplines of biology as possible and giving you a solid foundation in biological concepts for your upper level electives.  Introductory Biology is as much about inspiring you with the diversity of biological research, as it is about any particular topic.  You will learn a little about a lot of different topics, with the idea that you can use your upper division electives to pursue the topics you find most interesting.  We will cover four main, broad topics this semester: 1) Evolution and phylogenetics, 2) Diversity and the history of life, 3) Plant biology,  and 3) Ecology and population biology.

<p>By the end of the semester you should:
<ol>
<li>	understand the basic principles of evolution and how they unify all of biology.
<li>	develop a basic knowledge of the history and diversity of life on earth.
<li>	more fully understand how biotic and abiotic factors affect the distribution, abundance and behavior of organisms.
<li>	further develop skills in learning science as a process of asking and addressing questions rather than a collection of facts.
</ol>

<p><b> Bio 064L The Living Seas </b> <br>
<a href="/sgilman/syllabi/syllabus064L.pdf">past syllabus</a> and <a href="/sgilman/syllabi/lectureschedule064L.pdf">lecture schedule</a>
</p>
<p>
 The aim of this course will be to provide a broad overview of the diversity of marine habitats and the physical and biological processes that influence marine organisms.  We will explore: the geological and physical structure of the oceans, the diversity of plants and animals in the ocean, the interaction of organisms with one another and with their physical environment, and the effects of human activity on marine ecosystems.  At the end of the course, you should be able to:
<ol>
<li> Understand the basic process of scientific research and the scientific method
<li> Recognize and understand basic terms and concepts of marine biology.
<li> View marine plants and animals in the context of their environment, focusing on both traits that allow them to survive in particular habitats and those that limit their success.
<li> Understand the relevance of marine biology to current scientific, social, and economic arenas.
</ol>

<p><b> Bio 147 Biogeography </b> <br>
<a href="/sgilman/syllabi/Bio147_syllabus2012.pdf">past syllabus</a> 
</p>
<p>
 The aim of this course is to provide a broad overview of biogeography and the major processes structuring the distribution of species and communities.  We will cover the major ecological, evolutionary, and geological processes that influence distribution. We will also cover the effects of human activity on biogeographic patterns.  By the end of the course you will:

<ol>
<li>	be able to describe the major ecological, evolutionary, and geological processes that shape global patterns of biodiversity
<li>	be able to articulate a biogeographic perspective of important environmental problems, such as climate change or extinction
<li>	have gained practical experience with software programs commonly used in biogeographic research
<li>	have developed your writing and analytical skills through the completion of research project
</ol>

<p><b> Bio 169L Marine Ecology </b> <br>
<a href="/sgilman/syllabi/Bio169L_syllabus_Spr08.pdf"> past syllabus</a>
</p>
<p>This course will cover major topics in marine ecology and will concentrate on the coupling of physical and biological processes in the marine environment. We will also explore 
how climate interacts with the marine environment and recent changes that have occurred in  our oceans due to anthropogenic influence. Beginning with physical and chemical processes in the ocean which influence the ecology and biology of marine organisms, next we will discuss major groups of marine taxa, from single-celled phytoplankton through marine invertebrates (zooplankton and intertidal organisms) and vertebrates (fish, birds, and mammals). The information about major taxonomic groups will be presented in an ecological context (how these organisms interact and are influenced by their environment and other organisms). Additionally, we will explore and discuss the structure and function of particular marine habitats. The lab portion of the class will focus on identification, distribution, and diversity of local southern California marine organisms.  Field trips will introduce to students to local marine habitats and basic ecological techniques.

<p><b> Bio 175 Applied Biostatistics </b> <br>
<a href="/sgilman/syllabi/Syllabus_Biol175_F14.pdf" target="_blank"> past syllabus</a>
</p>
<p>This course is an introduction to descriptive and inferential statistics and experimental design.  The goal of statistics is to help us make decisions when information is limited or uncertain.  By the end of this course you should be able to:
<ul>
<li> Correctly use basic statistical methods for both descriptive and inferential statistics
<li>Incorporate statistical thinking into experimental design
<li>Critically analyze statistical information presented in both scientific papers and the general media.
</ul>

<p><b> FS 12 Science in the Public Imagination </b> <br>
Pitzer First Year Seminar<br>
<a href="/sgilman/syllabi/FYS12_Fall2014_Syllabus_v5.pdf" target="_blank"> past syllabus</a>
</p>
<p>From “Frankenfood” to “Intelligent Design,” we are bombarded in our daily lives with scientific (and
pseudoscientific) information. The goal of this seminar is to explore how science is presented, discussed,
and critiqued in the public sphere. We will focus on three central questions: How do people assess and
assimilate scientific information in the context of daily decision-making? How accurately are scientific
controversies presented in the media? How do the portrayals of science and scientists in fiction and film
affect public understanding of science? No prior science experience necessary.
