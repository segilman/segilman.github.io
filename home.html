<p>
I am interested in understanding how abiotic factors influence an organism's ecology and evolution; in particular, how temperature can affect patterns of local adaptation and population dynamics over both local and latitudinal spatial scales.
</p>
<p>
One major goal of my research is to understand how temperature influences the ecology and distribution of intertidal species.  Most recently I have been studying the effects of temperature on the vertical zonation population dynamics of the barnacle <i>Balanus glandula</i>.  Barnacles are one of the major space occupying organisms in the rocky intertidal, and their response to climate will affect a multitude of other species in the community.  I am using a combination of field experiments, laboratory studies of physiology and computer modelling to better understand how temperature affects this animal.  This work is funded by the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1351445&HistoricalAwards=false"> National Science Foundation</a>.
